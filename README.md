# UI Kit

first UI kit built out of React Components.

There are some limitations to this kind of UI Kit, for example:

What if we need to make the <Input /> disabled? We did not make it support the disabled attribute
What about other attributes that we didn't think about?
What about the massive amount of code duplicating the props into attributes?
How do we create several types of Buttons that differ in terms of design? For example, a Primary one and a Secondary one?
